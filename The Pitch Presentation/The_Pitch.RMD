## Introduction

Ever thought how would it be like if you type a word and suddenly get a recommendation for the next word to complete a sentence?

If yes, then this Text Predictor App is just for you.

This App was built using the trained model with Stupid Back Off via N-Grams Algorithm.

N-Grams are used to calculate the probability of a word in text. If a word with prob=0 is encountered, then it goes back to an n-1 gram level where the odds are multiplied by lambda(0.4) so the new probability is calculated as:

0.4 * P(“Desired Output”|“Text Input”)
